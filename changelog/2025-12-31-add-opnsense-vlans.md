Change:
Add VLAN interfaces to OPNsense for network segmentation.

Reason:
Prepare for VLAN-based separation of management, servers, clients, IoT, and lab systems.

Impact:
None expected. VLANs added but not yet enforced on switch ports.

Rollback:
Remove VLAN interfaces from OPNsense if issues arise.
